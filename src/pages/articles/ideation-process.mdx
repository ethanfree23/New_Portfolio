Seldom have I lacked an opinion. Often quite the contrary. “Why don’t they just do this?”, “They should come up with…”, “I bet if they combined this with this, and marketed it well, it would be a no-brainer.” And in the back of my mind, I knew they would have to be me, but I did not think I was capable of doing anything, and rightfully so. I had no focus or skill. Like an overgrown stem cell, I had yet to specialize.

The issue is, I do not want to specialize, per se. I would rather prefer to be like an artist with ideas: Whether it is a full blown business, a feature addition, and new process, or simply a higher degree of excellence, I saw opportunities for novel products or services, by simply recombining what is already available. Or magnifying what is already working, and excising the rest. The skill to put things together can be done by others. My goal: specialize in nothing, just think a ton, communicate, and help where you can.

I began to focus on design concepts and went from there. For instance: if one were to come up with a new restaurant idea, there are a number of ways to go about ideating possible products. Take a popular item and change the size, or the color. Or create a side dish to be the entree, or the opposite. Add bacon to anything. Pink boxes. Customizable orders. Chickpeas redesigned to taste like steak. The list goes on. Or think of another business model, and apply it to the subject industry: the Uber for food. The Airbnb for kitchens. The Amazon for recipes. The Instagram for chefs. Or one could focus on customer experiences: fine art for less than $100 per month, OEM parts ordered from a single platform, fast-food restaurant that actually gets your order correct, a search engine that is private-friendly. Cost, accessibility, accuracy, privacy: these are products that accompany many other products quite well.

As for how many alterations one should make to a current product varies depending on specific circumstances, but I would guess the medium number would be two or three. Adding nothing is simply competing with current competition, and would be difficult to take on. Adding one could be easy for the competition to duplicate. But two strong differentiating factors could target a specific niche and convert into early and strong adoption. Any more changes, and the product would be too new or different for the average customer to adopt. Not only is a startup competing with the status quo of the industry, it is also competing against the status quo of the customer base.

The best focus point is solving a problem, and there is no better validation step than trying to create one solution from start to finish. When I came up with the art rental idea, I was thinking of how bare my walls were, but how poor I was to purchase anything. Then the idea dawned on me: why don’t artist just rent the art to me directly, instead of hang on a coffee shop wall, hoping to sell. Quickly, I attempted a prototype of the idea and within a week, I had two pieces of rented art, each at $20 per month. I knew there was something there.

For my market research, I simply googled for art rotations or fine art subscriptions, and nothing worthwhile came up. I was driving for Uber at the time, so I asked all my passengers what they thought, and received more good feedback than bad. Boom, that was the market research.

Building the app was a pain in the ass, but the main idea was creating a rental feature. Nothing ground breaking, but to do it right, and for cheap, it was bound to take a while. The idea itself was like a stem cell: capable of specializing, but seeking to stay as nimble as possible so as not to close off from opportunity. As the product is developing, it is apparent what features to build based on user feedback.

At this point, I would say things are past the bulk of the ideation phase. The MVP is beginning to be used, and any advances will be user driven aka their ideas for the most part.
