Effective product demonstrations are crucial to accomplishing worthwhile sales as an entrepreneur. Whether it is a software, or a tangible product, showing your potential customers the benefits is the baseline focus. In particular, for software demonstrations, you want the customer to walk away feeling a personal connection to the application, not just information as if they watched a YouTube video.

Here are eight of my top focuses during a demonstration. Some I do fine by nature of who I am, others, I need to improve on. Nonetheless, here they are:

    1. Keep it simple. I do this well since I do not want to work too hard! Get to the point. This is not their first time seeing software, so there is no need to embellish. Do what you are there for.

    2. Focus on the benefits of the product, not the features. Often, I find myself giving an itinerary of our features, instead of speaking to the benefits of the features. We have x feature, the benefit is x, y, z.

    3. Be funny, lighthearted, and human. People are people, and they enjoy humor, personality, and knowing they are working with people like them. We all love sleep, we all have a favorite ice cream, and everyone has a paradise they want to find themselves in. Turns out, our product helps one obtain more of what they want personally!

    4. Real use cases. No story is more effective than a success from a similar client. Not only does this give you data and a focus, it brings them comfort.

    5. Let the prospect play. I struggle with this one, but hope to improve with time â€” create a demo environment for the customer to use, and you navigate them through the benefits. For HubOEM, we want to stress how easy it is to upload data, create a machine instance, and send a token to a customer so they can order spare parts without calling or emailing. So having the customer create an account all the way to impersonating the end client ordering the part all in the matter of a few minutes will sell our point soundly.

    6. Focus on pain points. Everyone has pain in their day-to-day operations; aspects of their operational flow that hurt, but they do not know there is another way. Highlighting this will give them hope and tap into their natural desire to work less for more output.

    7. Be meaningful with each sentence and click. Just like a good movie or book, every bit of communication and interaction needs to lead to somewhere. Or in other words, it needs to have a purpose. Know your intent, and focus on delivering just that.
