While I was at the University of Texas at Austin, I was lucky enough to be a part of a fraternity. The families in this fraternity had some impressive entrepreneurship accomplishments. While I had always been creative in a systems way, I never considered actually taking it seriously until then.

Being alive today, in my opinion, is cooler than any other time in history. Each person in a developed country lives a life that is akin to a god, compared to even kings of the past: running water, wagons to move themselves, ample food at every corner… But the greatest aspect of being alive today is our access to knowledge and infrastructure that allows us to leap frog a lot of the things that used to be barriers to entry. We have YouTube (you can literally learn to do anything), Google (files on files to learn from), and startups designed to make making startups easier (filing a company, accounting/finance software, finding engineers/builders, forums with expert opinions, etc.). With all these tools at our disposal, the trend of micro-entrepreneurship is on the rise. Back in the day, people might have their own farm, or weapons to hunt, and be self-sustaining. Now, the modern human can have a software in place of their farm, and be a tad better off. But overall, even without the fancy companies, information technology allows us to find other like minded individuals, which is the greatest value of all.

If I am serious about being an entrepreneur, there is no better way to get started than to just get started. Even if it fails, it is never a zero-sum game: there will be a lot to build on, for my next project. And, let’s say this is a complete disaster and I vow to never attempt entrepreneurialism again, the experience I gain will be valuable as a part of another company. However, if this is not a complete disaster, I should have enough money to at least help me with my car note. So now, my logic is, “Grow, or feel like I am missing out on realizing my potential.”

As for this idea in particular, fine art rentals: It is something I wanted for myself and could not find a service for. I was in a new apartment in Austin, circa 2017, and was annoyed at how bare my walls were. I thought there was surely a startup that connected users with local artists from whom they can rent small pieces of art. Kind of like a SaaS, but for art. So I guess, an AaaS? I looked around the internet, and could not find anything. Immediately, my mind started racing. I felt right off the bat that I was on to something huge, and it needed to be done… But this means I need to create it, right? But hold up, I know nothing about art nor creating a software. It has always had a barrier to entry, whether it be financial, cultural, or information. If I can devise a way to lower the barrier to entry, maybe other like-minded individuals will find it useful. I do know one thing for certain: If I were an artists, this is what I would be doing to create more financial stability for myself. And if I knew how to code, I would have it done in short order… But I know nothing.

I ran this idea by a friend of mine from college, and he told me to reach out to a friend of his who created a website for artists to connect with coffee shops. I pitched the developer on my idea. Though he liked it, he did not have the bandwidth to pursue it, but gave me admin access to the site. I found some cool pieces, reached out to the artist, and within a week of coming up with the idea, I had two pieces hanging on my wall, that I was renting for $20/piece/month. This is all the validation I needed. But life got in the way…

At the point in my life I came up with the idea, I was trying to get into medical sales, which is a full time job in and of itself. My goal was to land a solid job, stash some cash, and in two years time, have enough to hire someone to build the product. Once I got into medical sales, I was too busy to do anything, and did not have the discipline to deny myself sushi a few times a week. No stashed cash, only a desire stashed in my mind, brewing. I worked in trauma implant sales, then went to work at, what I believed at the time to be, my dream job doing spinal implant sales. The week I started, the manager that hired me was promoted to VP of Sales. I only got one phone call with him. He said, “The first two months on the job will dictate how you do. If you are working all the time, going to as many surgeries as possible, you will be fine. But if you decide to take it easy and sit on your couch, expect your career to be short-lived.” He said this to me the third week of March 2020. The next week, the hospitals shut down, and I found myself sitting on my couch, trying to learn surgeries from an iPad. Fast forward a few months, the world was starting to open up, and we had a new manager. This new manager came from a big territory in SoCal. Though he was chubby and needed an oxygen tank for a few days upon moving to Colorado, he allowed himself to think he was a mini-David Goggins mixed with a dictator. This combination meant one thing to me: it was time to brainstorm my next move, because time was running out. It was at this time I decided pursuing the startup was worthwhile. So, I began to get to work.

Starting is always the hardest part: I did not even attempt to learn to code (too much of a learning curve for me to handle on my own), but I did attempt no-code, and it was a no-go. I created a landing page, and it looked pretty fine, but it took forever. What I really wanted was someone to just build it for me. Through a good friend, I met a developer who loved the idea and wanted to work with me on it. Turns out, he is more of a backend guy, and had never built a website himself, but was confident he could make something. And through him, I met an artist who also does digital designs. On top of validating the idea as an artist, she was willing to help us with the designs. I thought this was going to come together nicely, but over time, nothing was happening. Well, except for what I feared would happen. Six months after the new manager arrived, our team of 8 was down to 3, and I was laid off. Thank God! He was a terrible person and the only thing I learned from him was how not to treat other people. On top of having a clear idea of what my next move would be, I was able to get unemployment insurance at the height of unemployment. This was the perfect time to move to Mexico!

I decided to live in Mexico for a few months to practice Spanish and save money while trying to get this thing off the ground. While in Mexico, I met a developer (while playing pool at a sketchy beachside bar) who had previously worked in Silicon Valley, and he was quite enthused about this idea. We decided to meet to discuss the idea more in depth, a few days later. What he said was music to my ears. He started by telling me how he would tackle this project, and ended saying he was fine-off financially, and would prefer equity. The only catch was that he needed the designs and flow mapped out, before he would work on anything. I figured this would only take about a month. Oh how I was wrong. About 6 months later (around November 2021), we finally had the designs and flow mapped out and he was able to get to work creating the product.

In the meantime, I tried my hand at making a podcast, aimed to interview artists and other art professionals about the business side of their practice. This was a bit nerve racking to begin, but after about 8 episodes, I felt pretty confident. The best part of the podcast was for me to learn more about the challenges artists face in trying to earn a living. I eventually decided to enroll in Flatiron School to learn to full-stack develop. While I have been in this program, I have had to put the podcast on hold. It personally kills me to not be consistent, but at this point in my life, I need to focus on developing skills I can live off of, before focusing on developing a podcast brand.

Since I have been in Houston after returning from Mexico, I have gone down to an art studio space called “The Silos” to run this idea by some artists and see if they would mind trying it out. Overall, the feedback has been great! The second Saturday of each month, they open their doors to customers and the halls fill for five hours of the day. This is the ideal environment to find artists, as well as customers. A few artists have agreed to try it out, and we are hoping to have 10 artists live by the second Saturday of March.

If all goes well, we will have some good problems to solve. First will most likely be further developing the software based on user feedback, both from artists, as well as customers. In order to grow, we need to find a marketing guru who can manage social media as well as run ad campaigns. If that goes well, and we acquire more users, we will need to find someone to help with HR and legal. Lastly, hiring someone for B2B sales and partnerships can help us solidify more long-term sources of revenue, to give us a nice cushion.

To date, this has been a fun, but challenging endeavor. My hunch was correct, so far: This is indeed not a zero-sum game. I have managed a project, learned coding (and Spanish), become more familiar with the art industry and the challenges artists face, and have met some pretty incredible people with a lot of passion and discipline. I am excited to see where this leads, and hope some day I can live off of this, which I feel would give me a great sense of ownership over myself, which in some ways is what we are all seeking.
